    Runner function - configures additional postprocessor file movements during the postprocessor stage of a task.

    The 'data' object argument includes:

        source_data             - Dictionary, data pertaining to the original source file.
        remove_source_file      - Boolean, should Unmanic remove the original source file after all copy operations are complete. (default: 'True' if file name has changed)
        copy_file               - Boolean, should Unmanic run a copy operation with the returned data variables. (default: 'False')
        file_in                 - String, the converted cache file to be copied by the postprocessor.
        file_out                - String, the destination file that the file will be copied to.
        run_default_file_copy   - Boolean, should Unmanic run the default post-process file movement. (default: 'True')
